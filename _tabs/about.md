Hi! I'm Gonzalo, a Chileanüá®üá± robotics enthusiast and hiking‚õ∞Ô∏è lover.

I'm currently enrolled in the Master's program of Electrical Engineering at *Universidad de Chile*, with particular interest in autonomous navigation & perception, as well as Reinforment Learning in robotics.

I work at the [Robotics Lab at UChile](https://uchile-robotics.github.io/index.html), where we develop new projects every semester on navigation, interaction, manipulation and simulation, with the goal to compete at the RoboCup@Home!
